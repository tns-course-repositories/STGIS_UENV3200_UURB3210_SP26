## US Census - Current

- **The U.S. Decennial Census** is a headcount of every person in the country, done once every 10 years. It collects only basic information (age, sex, race, Hispanic origin, relationship, and housing occupancy) to determine representation in Congress and the distribution of federal funds.

- **The American Community Survey (ACS)**, by contrast, is an ongoing yearly survey of a sample of households. It collects much more detailed information—such as education, income, employment, housing costs, and commuting patterns—to provide up-to-date social, economic, and housing data for communities between censuses.
